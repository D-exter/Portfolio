# Ice pong
Ice pong is a unique twist on the classic Pong game, where everything is set on an icy surface. The paddles and the ball slides across the slippery ice, making every move more challenging and unpredictable. Players must adjust their strategies and timing to account for the slippery nature of the game, as the ice affects the trajectory and speed of the ball.
